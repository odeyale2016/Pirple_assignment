# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''Game play:
ask for player names at the beginning
if 2 or 3 players start off by drawing 5 otherwise 7 cards, each at random
take turns in asking for cards of rank that is in their hand and either
	a. draw from the pile if the other player does not have the card
	b. or recieve the card(s) and ask again
make players take turns after each unsuccessful request or draw
put down each completed book/ set on the table
game is over when all thirteen books are won
the winner is the player with the highest score, i.e. most books
if player runs out of cards let them draw from the ocean/ pile before taking a turn
